# MapsIconPro



## Introduction

MapsiconPro is an upgraded version of the Mapsicon which you can find [here](https://github.com/djaiss/mapsicon). It contains every country of the world including Kosovo, Palestine, Marshall Islands, Tuvalu, and Micronesia (These countries were not present in the original version), also some territories are present too. Like the original version, MapsiconPro includes country shapes images of 11 different sizes from 16x16 pixels to 1024x1024. *Those maps are intented to serve as nice placeholders or illustations in your project - they do not replace real or extremely precise maps and they have no ambition to do so. *

## Specifications
 
 All the icons are transparent pngs, and are in a black color.  16x16px, 24x24px, 32x32px, 48x48px, 64x64px, 80x80px, 96x96px, 128x128px, 256x256px, 512x512px, and 1024x1024, also in .svg.
